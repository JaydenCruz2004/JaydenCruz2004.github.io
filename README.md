## 🌟 About Me

Hi there! 👋 I’m Jayden, and I’m deeply passionate about technology and its potential to shape the world. Growing up, I was captivated by how computers enable us to explore almost anything with just a few clicks. From binging YouTube videos to diving into random Wikipedia rabbit holes, my curiosity for how it all works "under the hood" led me to pursue a career in **technology**.

Some of my current interests include:
- **Cybersecurity** 🛡️
- **Data Science for Public Health** 📊
- **Software Development** 💻

I’m always looking for opportunities to apply my skills in meaningful ways, whether through internships, collaborative projects, or independent exploration.

## ⚡️ Vercel Speed Insights

This site now ships with the Vercel Speed Insights tracker so you can monitor Core Web Vitals for every page load.

1. **Enable the feature**: In the [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard), open your project → **Speed Insights** tab → **Enable**. This deploys the required `/_vercel/speed-insights/*` routes.
2. **Keep the CLI handy** (optional but helpful): `pnpm i -g vercel` (or `npm i -g vercel`, `yarn global add vercel`, etc.) so you can run `vercel pull`/`vercel deploy` locally.
3. **Deploy**: run `vercel deploy` (or push to the connected Git branch). After the deployment finishes, visit any page to start collecting real user performance data.
4. **Verify**: View your site source—each HTML page now includes `<script defer src="/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js"></script>` along with a small initializer (`js/speed-insights.js`) that registers the current route.
5. **Observe metrics**: Back in the dashboard, open the Speed Insights tab to explore LCP, FID, CLS, and other trends. Data appears after real traffic hits the site.

If you disable Speed Insights in Vercel, the inline scripts will safely no-op.
