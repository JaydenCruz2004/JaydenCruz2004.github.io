## 🌟 About Me

Hi there! 👋 I’m Jayden, and I’m deeply passionate about technology and its potential to shape the world. Growing up, I was captivated by how computers enable us to explore almost anything with just a few clicks. From binging YouTube videos to diving into random Wikipedia rabbit holes, my curiosity for how it all works "under the hood" led me to pursue a career in **technology**.

Some of my current interests include:
- **Cybersecurity** 🛡️
- **Data Science for Public Health** 📊
- **Software Development** 💻

I’m always looking for opportunities to apply my skills in meaningful ways, whether through internships, collaborative projects, or independent exploration.
